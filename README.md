6. The Home Office customer segment recorded the lowest sales ($429,653) and made the least profit ($60,299) of the 3 segments. 


## 💡 Conclusion and Recommendations
The weak areas identified by the analysis are;
(a) Low sales and profit in the Home Office customer Segment

(b) Heavy Cost on Tables, bookcases and Supplies resulting in losses.

(c) The Furniture category underperformed across all segments.

(d) All the losses made in Tables, bookcases and Supplies sub-categories were recorded in 10 States.

The following strategies are recommended to increase the profit margin in the weak areas:

- Phase out or optimize pricing for high-cost, low-margin items  
- Perform market research to reassess value perception for Furniture SKUs  
- Reduce excessive discounting in underperforming segments  
- Launch targeted campaigns to boost sales in the Home Office segment
