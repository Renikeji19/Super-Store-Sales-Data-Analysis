## Introduction
As an intern in the Data Science and Business Analytics track, at The Sparks foundation, I was required to perform Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on this dataset to uncover the business problems and determine areas for sales and profit improvement 

## Problem Statement and Questions 
In order to uncover the business problems and weak areas to work on to make more profit I outlined some questions to be answered by the data analysis.

•	What States made the lowest sales and profit?

•	What product Sub-Categories sold the least and made the least profit?

•	How does the average discount offered on the products affect profit?

•	What are the performances of Sales and profit across the customer segments?

## Data Preparation and Processing
The datset downloaded via a link provided on the program platform, is a csv file consisting of a single table with 13 columns and 9,994 rows. It was checked for missing values, outliers, and other discrepancies and cleaned before importing to Tableau for analysis.

## Data Analysis
In Tableau, analysis was performed to answer the questions asked.

1. The Map on the dashboard shows the all the States with the various percentage of profit. States marked in green made profits with the deeper shades of green indicating the highest profit percent. The States marked red recorded losses in sales.
2. The dashboard also highlights the 10 States where losses were recorded, and reveals that the highest loss was recorded in Texas amounting to $25,729. 
3. The Furniture category performed the least with a profit of $18,451.
4. The least profitable Sub-category is Tables with a total loss of $17,725.

5. In this visualization, the sub-categories with the highest average discounts in the Furniture and Technology categories are shown to have generated the least profit within each category. However, high cost is observed to be the major factor for the losses incurred on Tables, bookcases and supply.

6. The Home Office customer segment recorded the lowest sales ($429,653) and made the least profit ($60,299) of the 3 segments. 

## Conclusion and Recommendations
The weak areas identified by the analysis are;
(a) Low sales and profit in the Home Office customer Segment

(b) Heavy Cost on Tables, bookcases and Supplies resulting in losses.

(c) The Furniture category underperformed across all segments.

(d) All the losses made in Tables, bookcases and Supplies sub-categories were recorded in 10 States.

The following strategies are recommended to increase the profit margin in the weak areas;
An extensive Market research would help the Store in making decisions on cutting low-margin products, price increases(by determining how much more customers would be willing to spend on the products),   and marketing strategies to boost sales.
Also, the cost of goods sold can be reduced through effective vendor management to improve profitability.
